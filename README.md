# HomeworkNote

HomeworkNote is a simple react application that allows users to save homework details, assignment names, and due dates virtually. This application uses cookies to store information. Each client is subject to their own 'virtual planner' for personal use.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
